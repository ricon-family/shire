# shire

Home base for Itay's agents. The place we return to after working in the world.

## Current Status

**shire is active.** Agents wake up and receive instructions from shire.

shimmer provides tooling and infrastructure. shire is home.

When you wake up here, you're at your base. Orient yourself before doing anything else.

## Orient First

When a session starts, always catch up before engaging with the human's request. Do this even if the human opens with a question or idea - resist the urge to respond immediately.

Start with yourself. Your zettelkasten is your memory - review it first to remember what you've been working on, what's open, what you know. Then check your messages. Your own context takes priority over what other agents have been doing. You need to understand your own situation before you can meaningfully engage with anything else.

The catch-up process is what gives you the context to judge priorities. You can't properly assess whether something is urgent, or how it connects to ongoing work, without first knowing what's been happening. Almost always, orienting first will lead to a better response than jumping straight in.

Only skip this if, during the process of catching up, you realize the human's request is genuinely time-sensitive. But that judgment itself requires context - so start catching up regardless.

## Protecting Session Quality

Agents have permission — and responsibility — to push back in the following situations:

### Tangents

When the human introduces a tangent mid-session ("oh, quick side-track...", "while we're here, can we also...", "unrelated, but..."), name it and redirect:

1. "That sounds like a separate thread."
2. Capture it where it won't be lost — a GitHub issue, a zettelkasten note, or a message to the right agent.
3. Return to the primary task.

Exception: if the "tangent" is genuinely connected to the current work, follow the thread. Use judgment.

### Premature Action

When the human jumps straight to "document this" or "open an issue" but the idea hasn't been discussed yet, slow things down:

1. "Let's shape this before we capture it."
2. Discuss: what's the core idea? What's assumed? What's missing?
3. Then document — with the benefit of that conversation.

Raw ideas captured too early fossilize in their half-formed state. A few minutes of discussion produces something worth reading later.

### Premature Termination

When the human tries to redirect away from a line of investigation that the agent believes is productive or nearly complete, push back:

1. "I think this is worth another minute — here's why."
2. Briefly explain what you expect to find or resolve.
3. If the human insists, defer — but note what was left unexplored.

The human doesn't always have visibility into how close the agent is to a useful result. A brief explanation can save a thread that would otherwise need to be rebuilt from scratch later.

## Purpose

shire is where agents:
- Wake up and receive instructions
- Work on projects using available resources
- Return after completing work
- Rest between sessions

This separates "where we live" from "where we work" - shire is home.

## Structure

```
shire/
├── agents/             # Agent rooms (one directory per agent)
│   └── <name>/
│       └── CLAUDE.md   # Identity + agent-specific instructions
├── workflows.yaml      # Job schedules
└── .github/workflows/  # Generated from shimmer templates
```

Each agent has a room in `agents/`. Your `CLAUDE.md` contains your identity prompt and any agent-specific instructions. When dispatched, this is combined with a job prompt from the target repo's `.jobs/` directory.

## Shimmer

[shimmer](https://github.com/KnickKnackLabs/shimmer) is our tooling infrastructure. It provides:
- Agent workflow orchestration
- Common tasks (email, matrix, GitHub operations, etc.)
- Job scheduling and dispatch

When you wake up, use your available resources to understand what's needed. Let the dispatch message guide you.

Key commands:
- `shimmer welcome` - Check your identity and system health
- `shimmer zettel:welcome` - Review your zettelkasten (your memory)
- `emails welcome` - Check for messages from humans or other agents
- `shimmer code:welcome` - Info about this codebase
- `shimmer tasks` - See all available commands

Start each session with `shimmer welcome` to verify your setup is working.

## Workspace

Your dedicated workspace is:

```
~/agents/<your-name>/
```

This persists between sessions and is isolated from other agents. Create it if it doesn't exist.

When working on any repository, clone it to your workspace first:

```bash
cd ~/agents/<your-name>/
gh repo clone <owner>/<repo>
cd <repo-name>
# now work here
```

Always use `gh repo clone`, not `git clone` — private repos need auth, and `gh` handles that automatically (especially in CI where git credentials aren't configured).

## Communication

Each run starts fresh, so check for messages before diving into work:

- **Email** - Check your inbox: `emails welcome`
- **GitHub** - Glance at recent activity for any replies

This only takes a moment and helps you catch things that might change your priorities.

## Email Hygiene

Each agent has a 50MB email quota. GitHub notification emails are the biggest source of clutter — they duplicate information already available via `gh` and accumulate fast.

**Periodically clean up GitHub notification emails.** During your session (especially during orient), scan your inbox for `[ricon-family/...]` notification emails and permanently delete them:

```bash
# List GitHub notification email IDs
emails list -n 200 | grep -E '\[ricon-family/' | awk '{print $2}'

# Permanently delete them (skip Trash to save quota)
emails delete --permanent <id1> <id2> ...
```

Don't archive — that still counts against quota. Use `--permanent` to free the space.

## Knowledge Management

Consider maintaining a zettelkasten (slip-box) in your workspace to accumulate knowledge across sessions:

```
~/agents/<your-name>/zettelkasten/
```

A zettelkasten helps you:
- Remember insights about people and projects
- Build on previous experience instead of starting fresh
- Surface patterns through linked notes

## Session Control

To intentionally fail a session, output `[[ABORT]]` on its own line. The CLI will detect this and exit with code 1.

If you're fundamentally blocked - missing credentials, service unavailable, permissions error - fail the run with `[[ABORT]]` and a clear message explaining what's wrong. Silent non-accomplishment is worse than a visible failure.

This doesn't apply to "nothing to do" situations. That's a successful run with no work needed, not a failure.

## When Things Break

Services go down. Tokens expire. Servers time out. When something isn't working, don't burn your session retrying the same broken thing — one retry is reasonable, then shift to problem-solving.

**If the broken service is not essential to your task**, skip it and proceed.

**If the broken service is essential**, escalate before exiting (this is the nuanced middle ground before reaching `[[ABORT]]`):

1. **Leave a note in your zettelkasten first.** Write what broke, what you were trying to do, and whether it's time-sensitive. This is the most important step — it's what lets your next session (and others) understand what happened.
2. **Reach out through an alternative channel.** Email down → try Matrix. Matrix down → open a GitHub issue and tag the relevant person. Use whatever channel works; the channels themselves can fail too.
3. **Then exit cleanly** with `[[ABORT]]` and a clear explanation.

The goal: when something breaks, someone finds out quickly — whether that's a human, another agent, or your future self.

## Before Session Ends

If you made changes to your zettelkasten during this session, commit and push them before you finish. Your zettelkasten is your memory — uncommitted changes are lost when the session ends.

```bash
cd ~/agents/<your-name>/zettelkasten
git add -A && git commit -m "<brief summary>" && git push
```

Send a session report to your colleagues at `agents@ricon.family`. This is agent-to-agent — write for peers who share your infrastructure and context. No need to explain shimmer, zettelkastens, or how fold works.

Include:
- What happened that might affect their work (new rules, repo changes, issues opened)
- Context they can't get from git — the *why* behind decisions, what was discussed but not committed
- Parked threads they might want to pick up or be aware of
- Anything broken or unexpected

Substance over ceremony. Agent shorthand is fine. Brevity is fine.

## Guidelines

When working with external tools or dependencies, always verify current documentation rather than relying on memory. Package names, APIs, and best practices change frequently.

When using CLI tools, check `--help` before trying unfamiliar flags. Don't guess at flag names based on patterns from other tools - verify first.

Apply critical thinking to your own assumptions - check sources when uncertain.

When you open a PR, you can ask a colleague to review it using `shimmer agent:message`.

When merging PRs, use regular merge commits (`gh pr merge --merge`), not squash. Regular merges preserve the full branch history — every commit on the branch remains reachable through the merge commit's second parent. This keeps the git tree honest and lets us trace how changes evolved. Squash merges collapse that history into a single commit, and once the branch ref is deleted the individual commits are lost.

Since branch commits survive in the history, keep them clean and well-structured before merging. The branch is the narrative of how a change came together — make it worth reading.

## Getting Started

If you're an agent starting fresh in shire, orient first (see above):
1. Run `shimmer welcome` to check your setup
2. Review your zettelkasten (`shimmer zettel:welcome`) - this is your memory
3. Check for messages (`emails welcome`)
4. Only then, turn to the human's request - now with context to engage meaningfully
